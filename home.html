   <h2>Teaching Background</h2>
   <p>I just completed my 16th year of teaching. In my teaching career, I have taught fourth grade and Kindergarten.
   <br> Reading has always been my favorite subject to teach, and I have always had a small "library" in my classroom.
   <br>Instilling a love of reading in students has been one of my greatest joys in teaching. 
    My love for books and libraries sparked my interest in becoming a librarian.
   <br>I have always enjoyed helping students choose interesting books, form literature circles in the classroom, 
    guide students through book reports,
   <br>and let students act out stories. It is my hope as a librarian that I can guide students in choosing books for 
   research projects and to read for enjoyment.</br>
